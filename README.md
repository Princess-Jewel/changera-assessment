I couldnt completely initialize the Github OAuth because there's a CORS policy on the OAuth route to get the token. So when the browser makes a request to the endpoint, it doesnt recognize the request. It blocks it. I'd be needing a BackEnd Service to complete the process. Asides that, i hope i get a positive feedback. Thank you.
